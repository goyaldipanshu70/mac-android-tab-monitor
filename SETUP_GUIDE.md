# 🚀 TabMonitor Complete Setup Guide

## 📋 What You Have Now

I've created **4 different ways** to use TabMonitor:

1. **macOS Swift App** (Original) - Professional native app
2. **Python Server** (Quick Start) - Works immediately
3. **Android Kotlin App** (Best Experience) - Full-featured mobile app  
4. **Python Test Client** (For Testing) - Desktop GUI client

## 🎯 Recommended Quick Start

### **Step 1: Start the Server** ⚡

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/deepanshugoyal/Projects/tab-monitor

# Start the Python server (easiest)
./start-server.sh
```

You should see:
```
🚀 TabMonitor Server Started!
📱 Connect your Android device to: 192.168.1.70:8080
🔄 Waiting for connections...
```

**Note the IP address** (in this case: `192.168.1.70`) - you'll need this!

### **Step 2: Test with Python Client** 🐍

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
# Install tkinter if needed (usually pre-installed)
/Users/deepanshugoyal/Projects/tab-monitor/.venv/bin/python -m pip install pillow

# Start the test client
cd /Users/deepanshugoyal/Projects/tab-monitor/python-client
/Users/deepanshugoyal/Projects/tab-monitor/.venv/bin/python tabmonitor_client.py
```

This opens a GUI where you can:
1. Enter the server IP (`192.168.1.70`)
2. Click "Connect"
3. See your MacBook screen
4. Click on the image to control your MacBook!

## 📱 For Your Android Tablet

### **Option A: Build Android App** (Best Experience)

1. **Install Android Studio**:
   ```bash
   # Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   ```

2. **Open Project**:
   - Launch Android Studio
   - File → Open → `/Users/deepanshugoyal/Projects/tab-monitor/android-client`

3. **Connect Tablet**:
   - Enable "Developer Options" on your tablet
   - Enable "USB Debugging"
   - Connect via USB

4. **Build & Install**:
   - Click the green "Run" button in Android Studio
   - The app will install and launch automatically

### **Option B: Manual APK Build** (If you have Android SDK)

```bash
cd /Users/deepanshugoyal/Projects/tab-monitor
./install-android.sh
```

## 🖥️ Using the Professional macOS App

If you want the full native experience:

1. **Install Xcode** (from Mac App Store)
2. **Open Project**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/deepanshugoyal/Projects/tab-monitor/macos-server
   open TabMonitorServer.xcodeproj
   ```
3. **Build & Run** (Cmd+R)
4. **Grant Permissions** when prompted

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"Server won't start"**
```bash
# Make sure port 8080 is free
lsof -i :8080
# If something is using it, kill it or change port in server code
```

### **"Can't connect from Android"**
1. Verify both devices are on **same WiFi network**
2. Check firewall isn't blocking port 8080
3. Try IP address shown in server terminal

### **"Screen capture not working"**
- Grant "Screen Recording" permission in:
  System Preferences → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

### **"Touch events don't work"**
- Install pyautogui: `pip install pyautogui`
- Grant "Accessibility" permission if prompted

## 📊 Performance Tips

- **Reduce Quality**: Edit `tabmonitor_server.py`, change `quality=70` to `quality=50`
- **Lower FPS**: Change `time.sleep(1/30)` to `time.sleep(1/15)` for 15 FPS
- **Smaller Resolution**: Change `width//2, height//2` to `width//4, height//4`

## 🎉 What You Can Do Now

✅ **Use your Android tablet as a second monitor**  
✅ **Touch the tablet to control your MacBook**  
✅ **Wireless connection over WiFi**  
✅ **Multiple devices can connect simultaneously**  
✅ **Real-time screen mirroring**  

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start with Python version** (easiest to test)
2. **Build Android app** for best mobile experience  
3. **Try the native macOS app** for production use
4. **Customize settings** for your network/preferences
